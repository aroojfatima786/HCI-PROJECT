# Smart Data Entry Automation App – HCI Project

This project is a **Smart Data Entry Automation App** developed for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at the **University of Management and Technology (UMT)**.

It is designed to enhance the user experience during data entry by automating key tasks like importing files, validating input, integrating multiple data sources, and customizing interface settings. The app follows core HCI principles to ensure usability, accessibility, and efficiency.


## 🔧 Features

- **Dashboard**: View system activity and quick-access tools
- **Data Import**: Upload data from external sources (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- **Data Integration**: Merge multiple datasets into a unified view
- **Validation**: Automatic checks for missing fields, duplicates, or invalid entries
- **Settings**: Customize input rules, formats, and interface preferences
- **User Interface**: Clean layout with consistent design, meaningful feedback, and minimal complexity

## 🧠 HCI Principles Applied

- Consistency in visual layout
- Feedback after user actions (e.g., import success or validation error)
- Prevention of errors before saving data
- User control and easy navigation
- Reduced cognitive load through intuitive design

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Use the dashboard to:
   - Import data
   - Run validation
   - Configure settings
   - View processed output
